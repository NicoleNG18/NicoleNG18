About me
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm 19 years old girl from Kyustendil, Bulgaria. :woman:

I have fundamental knowledge at C# and I’m currently focused on Java. I studied at Software University (SoftUni).
Like all students, I also have other interests. Ten years ago, I started training volleyball and that’s my biggest passion. I also love listening to music, doing puzzles and taking walks in the forest. :musical_score:

During my Java WEB module at SoftUni I made my first mini website called Food Delivery, developed with Spring, Thymeleaf and MySQL. If you want, go and take a look at it from the repository below.

In 2024, I participated in the National Olympiad in Information Technologies (NOIT) and advanced to the final round. There, I presented my second website, PE Scores, and received a grade of 5.50.
