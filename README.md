About me
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the past year, I discovered low-code platforms like Eclipse Dirigible — and it completely changed the way I approach building software. Fast, flexible, and creative, it felt like unlocking a new dimension in development.

Before that, I was already deeply passionate about web programming. I’ve worked with Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and MySQL, and have hands-on experience using the Spring Framework to build full-stack applications.

Right now, I’m studying Information Systems at FMI Sofia. The academic journey has helped me ground my skills in theory while continuing to build in practice.

I created my first mini website, Food Delivery, during the Java Web module at SoftUni, using Spring, Thymeleaf, and MySQL. In 2024, I reached the finals of the National Olympiad in Information Technologies (NOIT), presenting my second project, PE Scores.

Outside the code editor, you’ll probably find me playing volleyball (over ten years strong), solving puzzles, listening to music, or walking in the forest.
This space reflects what I build, what I learn, and what keeps me curious.
