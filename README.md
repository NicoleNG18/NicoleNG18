About me
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm 19 years old girl from Kyustendil, Bulgaria. :woman:

Over the past year, I discovered the power and potential of low-code platformsâ€” particularly Eclipse Dirigibleâ€” and quickly fell in love with them. This new area of development opened up exciting opportunities for building applications faster and more efficiently, complementing my background as a passionate web programmer.

I have a solid foundation in a range of programming languages and frameworks, including Java, C++ HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Iâ€™ve gained hands-on experience working with the Spring Framework for building robust Java-based applications, and Iâ€™m proficient in using MySQL for effective database management.

Currently, Iâ€™m expanding my knowledge through my studies in Information Systems at FMI Sofia. This academic path is helping me deepen my technical expertise and gain a broader understanding of software development principles and best practices.

Outside of programming, Iâ€™m a well-rounded individual with a love for sports and creative hobbies. Iâ€™ve been playing volleyball for over ten yearsâ€” my greatest passion. I also enjoy listening to music, solving puzzles, and walking in the forest to recharge. ðŸŽµ

One of the projects Iâ€™m most proud of is my first mini website, Food Delivery, which I developed during the Java Web module at SoftUni. It was built using Spring, Thymeleaf, and MySQL. Feel free to check it out in my GitHub repository below!

In 2024, I participated in the National Olympiad in Information Technologies (NOIT) and advanced to the final round. There, I presented my second website, PE Scores, and received a grade of 5.50.
